## Other Solution

### Using Python (Line-by-Line Processing)

Reads the log file line by line and writes matching logs to an output file. This method is easy to implement but slower due to Pythonâ€™s overhead and higher memory usage. It is not ideal for very large files (~1TB).

### Using Bash with `while read` Loop

Uses a simple shell script to read each line and check if it starts with the target date. This method is very slow because it processes the file sequentially and cannot take advantage of efficient text processing tools like grep or awk. It is not recommended for large log files.


## Final Solution

Argument Handling: The date is passed as a command-line argument.

File Streaming (ifstream): Reads the file line by line.

String Matching: Checks if the start of the line matches the target date.

Output Writing (ofstream): Writes matching lines to an output file.

Performance Optimizations
Single-pass scan (O(n)): Only reads and processes each line once.

No extra memory usage: Uses streaming instead of loading the entire file.

Fast comparison: Uses compare() on the first 10 characters (YYYY-MM-DD).

This ensures the solution is fast, memory-efficient, and scalable for a 1TB log file.

## Steps to run 

1. Compile the Code
Open a terminal in the directory where your `extract_logs.cpp` file is located and run:


`g++ test.cpp -o extract_logs`


This will generate an executable named `extract_logs`.

2. Run the Program
Execute the compiled program by providing a date as an argument:


`./extract_logs 2024-12-01`


Output
The logs for 2024-12-01 will be extracted and saved in:
